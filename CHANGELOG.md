## Unreleased
### Added
- A Roblox standard library can now be generated by simply having `std = "roblox"` in your configuration and running selene. If it does not exist, it will create one. This can also be initiated manually with `selene generate-roblox-std`.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-11-08
### Added
- Added `--color` option to specify whether colors could be used on the output.
- Added [`incorrect_roact_usage`](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/incorrect_roact_usage.html) lint to verify correct usage of Roact.createElement.
- Added [`unscoped_variables`](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/unscoped_variables.html) lint to disallow usage of unscoped (global) variables.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-11-06
