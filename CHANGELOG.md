### Added
- Added `CFrame.fromEulerAngles` to the Roblox standard library.
- Added `validate-config` command, which will report any errors in your configuration.

### Fixed
- "Legacy" Roblox enums (such as Enum.RaycastFilterType.Whitelist/Blacklist) are now automatically created and marked as deprecated in generated standard libraries.
- Fixed a bug where `manual_table_clone` would incorrectly lint code in loops. ([#479](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/479))

## [0.24.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.24.0) - 2023-01-10
### Added
- Added new [`manual_table_clone` lint](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/manual_table_clone.html), which will catch manual re-implementations of `table.clone` in Luau.
- Added `filename` field to diagnostic message labels in JSON output, indicating for which file the message was generated (#453)

### Changed
- Improved the error message for using a standard library that can be detected as outdated.
- Updated internal parser, giving support for string interpolation for Luau and fixing some parsing bugs.

### Fixed
- Fixed "library" being typo'd as "libary" in the error when finding a usage.

## [0.23.1](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.23.1) - 2022-12-06
### Fixed
- Fixed event warnings not being possible to filter out with `roblox_incorrect_roact_usage`.

## [0.23.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.23.0) - 2022-12-06
### Added
- Added `--display-style=json2`, which gives the same outputs as `--display-style=json`, but with an extra `type` field so that it can support more than diagnostics. Extensions should move over to `--display-style=json2` as more becomes available for it, but take care to check for `type`. Currently the only possible value is "Diagnostic".
- Added `rawlen` to the Luau standard library.
- Added `Font.fromEnum`, `Font.fromName`, and `Font.fromId` to the Roblox standard library.
- Added the missing `table.foreachi` function to Lua 5.1 standard library as deprecated.

### Fixed
- `warn` in the Roblox standard library now properly works with all data types instead of only strings.

## [0.22.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.22.0) - 2022-10-15
### Added
- Added `--allow-warnings` option to have selene pass when only warnings occur.
- Added the ability to allow specific patterns in the `deprecated` lint.
- Added exclude option to selene.toml for excluding files from lints
- Adds support for `.yaml` extensions to be used for standard libraries alongside `.yml`.
- Normalized "lint" terminology over "rule" throughout codebase. "rules" in `selene.toml` should now be "lints", but "rules" will still be supported for backwards compatibility.

### Changed
- Updated internal parser, giving substantial parsing speed increases.

## [0.21.1](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.21.0) - 2022-09-19
### Fixed
- Fixed not being able to use projects without selene.toml.

## [0.21.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.21.0) - 2022-09-17
### Added
- `undefined_variable` now properly catches `global` as undefined in `function global.name()`.
- Added the "luau" builtin library.
- `unused_variable` and `incorrect_standard_library_use` will now suggest configuring a standard library if one is detected.
- Added `constant_table_comparison` check to catch `x == {}`, which will always fail.
- Added `high_cyclomatic_complexity` check to catch overly complex functions that are hard to test, and harder to reason about. This lint is disabled by default.
- Added `Font.new` to the Roblox standard library.
- `roblox_incorrect_roact_usage` now lints for invalid events.

### Changed
- Match `.luau` filename extension by default.
- Allow `--pattern` to be passed multiple times.
- `roblox_incorrect_roact_usage` now uses the generated standard library to know what classes and properties exist, meaning a selene update is no longer necessary to update.
- Roblox standard libraries are now guaranteed to regenerate when the previously generated standard library is on a different version.

### Fixed
- Fixed `unused_variable` incorrectly tagging `function global.name()` when `global` is defined in the standard library.
- Fixed `unscoped_variables` incorrectly tagging `function global.name()` as creating an unscoped variable for `global`.
- Fixed `roblox_incorrect_roact_usage` always showing the class name as "Instance". ([#297](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/297))
- `roblox_incorrect_roact_usage` will now find instances of createElement that do not specify properties.
- Fixed issues where `roblox_incorrect_color3_new_bounds` would sometimes fail to run.

## [0.20.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.20.0) - 2022-07-21
### Added
- Added [`utf8` globals](https://q-syshelp.qsc.com/Content/Control_Scripting/Lua_5.3_Reference_Manual/Standard_Libraries/4_-_Basic_UTF-8_Support.htm) to the builtin `lua53` standard library.
- Added Roblox datatype constructors `CatalogSearchParams.new`, `FloatCurveKey.new`, and `RotationCurveKey.new`.

### Changed
- Errors for generating Roblox API dumps are now more detailed.

### Fixed
- Fixed newer versions of the Roblox API dump failing to create standard libraries for.
- Fixed reporting an error when generating standard libraries panicking.

## [0.19.1](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.19.1) - 2022-06-22
### Fixed
- Fixed releases coming with Tracy.

## [0.19.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.19.0) - 2022-06-22
### Added
- `table.insert(x)` no longer counts as a read to `x`, which allows selene to alert you that you are only assigning to it.
  - This is done through a new standard library field for arguments called `observes`. This takes 3 values: "read-write" (the default), signifying a potential read and write, "read", signifying only a read, and "write", signifying only a write. Only "write" has meaning at this time.
- Added new `must_use` lint, which will warn you when you are not using the return value of a function that performs no other behavior.
  - This is done through a new standard library field for functions called `must_use`. Set it to `true` to gain this functionality.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bunch of performance failures, lowering some benchmarks from 3 seconds to 200ms.

## [0.18.2](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.18.2) - 2022-06-10
### Fixed
- Fixed `Enum.NAME.Value` failing in newly generated standard libraries.

## [0.18.1](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.18.1) - 2022-06-07
### Changed
- [Updated internal parser](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0151---2022-02-17), bringing bug fixes to type information with generic packs.

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.18.0) - 2022-06-07
### Added
- Added [new YAML based standard library format](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/usage/std.html). The old TOML format is now deprecated and will not have any new functionality added to it, but will be preserved for the forseeable future.
  - You can upgrade old TOML standard libraries by running `selene upgrade-std library.toml`, which will create a new .yml file of the same name in the new format.
  - This only affects **standard library files**. `selene.toml` has not changed.
- Added new [`deprecated` lint](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/deprecated.html), which can be configured [by standard libraries](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/usage/std.html#deprecated).
- Added `debug.resetmemorycategory` to the Roblox standard library.
- Added `debug.setmemorycategory` to the Roblox standard library.
- Added `--no-summary` option to suppress summary information.

### Changed
- Roblox standard library files are now no longer generated in the project directory, and will be updated automatically every 6 hours. You can update it manually with `selene update-roblox-std`.
  - As per the deprecation of TOML standard libraries, you should delete your `roblox.toml` if you have one.
  - It is possible to pin a standard library in the same way `roblox.toml` was if you are in an environment where you do not want automatic updates, such as one where you want to limit selene's internet usage. Learn more [on the Roblox Guide documentation page](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/roblox.html).

### Removed
- With the introduction of the new `deprecated` lint, the `--deprecated` field has been removed from `generate-roblox-std`, and is now implied.

- Added `CFrame.identity` to the Roblox standard library.
- Added `gcinfo` to the Roblox standard library.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where empty else blocks were not properly closing their scope, meaning that they could confuse the shadowing lint. [(#116)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/116)

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.15.0) - 2021-11-05

- Added `Enum:GetEnums()` to the Roblox standard library. [(#312)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/312)
- `roblox_incorrect_color3_new_bounds` now checks for if the given number is negative. [(#83)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/83)

### Fixed
- Fixed standard library error when missing files. [(#272)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/272)
- Fixed display style option triggering `ArgumentConflict` when using quiet option. [(#288)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/288)

- Updated internal parser, adding new Luau syntax.

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.14.0) - 2021-07-07
### Added
- Added `task` library to Roblox standard library.

### Changed
- `mismatched_arg_count` now tries to find the best overlap between multiple definitions, rather than ignoring them entirely. This means that if you have `f(a)` and `f(b, c)` defined, then calling `f(1, 2, 3)` will now lint instead of silently passing, since no definition provided meets it.
- `mismatched_arg_count` now shows all function definitions, rather than the local variable assignment. [(#259)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/259)

### Fixed
- Updated internal parser, fixing some bugs with Roblox parsing. [See the changelog here](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0131---2021-07-07).

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.13.0) - 2021-07-01
### Added
- Added `debug.info` to the Roblox standard library. [(#260)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/260)
- Tokenization errors now form rich diagnostics.

### Changed
- Updated internal parser.
- Optimized linting process to run better with multiple threads.

### Fixed
- Fixed internal selene panics exiting with a zero code. Panics will now exit with status code 1, allowing it to be picked up by CI.
- Fixed variables named `self` not showing as unused if `allow_unused_self` was enabled. The implicit `self` variable being unused will still respect this configuration. [(#215)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/215)

## [0.12.1](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.12.1) - 2021-05-26
### Fixed
- Fixed compile warning about unused variables.

### Added
- `arg` is now defined in the Lua 5.1 standard library.
- Root level `...` will no longer be declared an undefined variable.
- Using `...` past the first depth will now error with `undefined_variable`, as it is guaranteed improper code.
- You can now combine a function with fields inside standard libraries. This is useful for something like `expect()` and `expect.extend()`.
- Added `mismatched_arg_count` lint which will lint against too many arguments passed to calls for locally defined functions.
- Added `duplicate_keys` lint for checking keys defined more than once inside a table.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where some indexes of Roblox structures would fail (such as `workspace.CurrentCamera.ViewportSize.X`)
- Fixed a bug where chaining `roblox` with another standard library would not read the other standard library if `roblox` was being generated.
- Fixed a bug where `0.5 * x` would always resolve to a number.

### Changed
- Updated internal parser. This has shown in practice to catch lints that the previous version did not.

- Fixed a bug where the `almost_swapped` lint would panic if the last line was an assignment [(#93)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/93)

### Changed
- Changed the argument display type of `io.input` and `io.output` into `file`
- Updated to version 0.5.0 of full-moon, which should result in speedier parsing

- Fixed parenthese conditions mixed with non-parenthese conditions (such as `(condition) and condition`) tripping the `parenthese_conditions` lint.

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/releases/tag/0.4.2) - 2019-11-13
### Fixed
- Fixed Roblox standard library not including structs, and thus failing when using `game`, `script`, etc.
